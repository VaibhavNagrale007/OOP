===== * Theory * =====
1. Constructors
    In class-based, object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special 
    type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments 
    that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
2. Types : 1. Default           : constructor which doesnâ€™t take any argument. It has no parameters. It is also called a zero-argument constructor. 
           2. Paramatrised      : constructor with arguments
           3. Copy constructors : A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class
