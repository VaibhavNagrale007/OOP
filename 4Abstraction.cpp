===== * Theory * =====
1. Abstraction
    Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 
    Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data 
    to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
    eg. man driving a car has noting to do with how engine works he just uses it
    Implementation :    1. Abstraction using Classes
                        2. Abstraction using Header files
2. Virtual functions
    It tells the compiler to perform late binding where the compiler matches the object with the right called function and executes it during the runtime.
    declared in the base class using the keyword virtual and is re-defined (Overriden) in the derived class.
        Base Class    : class from which the other classes are derived and inherit the methods and properties (Parent/Super class) 
        Derived Class : class that is constructed from a base class and has all qualities of base class plus it's own someting new (Child/Sub class)
3. Pure Virtual function/Abstract Class
    Abstrat Class         : Sometimes implementation of all function cannot be provided in a base class because we donâ€™t know the implementation. 
                            Such a class is called abstract class. As here we used AskForPromotion (Abstraction).
    Pure Virtual Function : A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we can have implementation, 
                            but we must override that function in the derived class, otherwise the derived class will also become abstract class
                            A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration
